This is a simulation for Graham Scan, an algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of points.\nA convex hull is the smallest convex set that contains a set of points on a plane.\nA good analogy for this is imagining putting a rubber band around the set. The final shape of the rubber band is the convex hull of that set.\nConvex hulls can be found through many methods, and a common algorithm is Graham Scan, which computes the hull in O(nlogn) time.\nThe first step is to find the point with the lowest y coordinate. Label it P.\nAfter the point is found, sort the points in increasing order of the angle they and point P make with the x-axis.\nAny sorting algorithm can be used here, but an O(nlogn) algorithm is optimal here.\nAfterwards, consider the points in sequence. If travelling from the previous two points to the current point is a left or right turn.\nIf it is a left turn, continue with the new point added to the hull. Otherwise, discard the point and select the next point.\nThis process will eventually reach the last point, at which point the algorithm is complete and the convex hull is computed.\n
